Adds Bluestone to Minecraft 1.8(not even done) and 1.7.10. Exactly the same as Redstone but blue.

If you see the account, "invalid-email-address", that's not really an account, I accidentally used that "invalid-email-address" in some of my commits and its not me. And the github authors did not create this mod, I (TheSlarFab), created this mod.
