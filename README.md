# Bluestone-Mod
Adds Bluestone to Minecraft 1.8 (You can edit this and publish it because the mod is pretty boring to me BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT! Or you will get reported!)

If you see the account, "idk123456789", thats my other account,
If you see the account, "invalid-email-address", that's not really an account, I accidentally used that "invalid-email-address" in some of my commits and its not me. And the github authors did not create this mod, I (TheSlarFab), created this mod.
